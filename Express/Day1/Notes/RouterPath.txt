Both are not same, because both are having different http methods.

Route paths, in combination with a
request method, define the
endpoints at which requests can be
made


combination of http method and the path called Route path.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters ?, +, *, and () as used
in regular expression can be used in
route paths as well.

The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are
interpreted literally by string-based
paths


See the example in router-path.js

1. ? , if the user missed one character as abcd, but user typed as acd, then also it will work.
ab?cd, if user typed acd also works fine.

2. +, if the user typed the particular character multiple times also it works.  
ab+cd, if user typed abbbbbbbbcd also works fine.

3. *, user can type anything in the place of * also works fine.
ab*cd, if the user typed abswethacd also works fine

4. () ?, ? mark is used for one character optional, if we want more than one char also it works.
a(bc)?d, if the user typed ad also works fine. One important thind, we cant use immediately after /.

The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) for more readibility.
