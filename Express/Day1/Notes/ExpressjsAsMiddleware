Express.js provides a way to listen to the requests of specific URLs and respond by using a
callback function.

A web framework like Express.js operates through functions considered to be middleware
because they sit between HTTP interaction on the web and the Node.js platform.


Express acts as a middleWare b/w request and response. Once the request is received from the frontend
before respond, express does something(like validation, whether the url is correct or not, if not then it will respond as 404 NOT FOUND).
