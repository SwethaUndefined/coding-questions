JWT is npm package used to authendicate.

Have to create a unique key, the user has to give that unique key every time when they login to
authendicate the user.

See the example in login api.


Everytime the user enters the private key is checked with DB and then send the result as response.

After the token(private key) is created we have to created it in local storage.

Now we are created that authendication in login api only, if i go other api it still shows. For that i 
have created middleware.

We have to send that token in header part for every api. Then have to extract that token from header.
That i do it in auth.js.



Once we created the middleware in auth.js then export that file and then use wherever we want to check
the token.


Now go to tutorial route and then import it.

then use it.
