A signed cookie is simply a signature attached to the cookie.
So, the cookie will still be visible to the client. However, it has a signature. So, the server side
code can detect if the client modified the cookie or not.
 If the signature does not match, then it will give an error


 res.cookie('name', 'value', {signed: true})


Browsers are supposed to support at least 4096 bytes per cookie. To ensure that you do
not exceed the limit, donâ€™t exceed the size of 4093 bytes per domain.
