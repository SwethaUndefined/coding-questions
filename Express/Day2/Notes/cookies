We can create our own cookies also.
Cookies are used to track user interactions or used to get back some information. 

Every cookie object has an expiry time. It could range from as low as session* time to a few
years.

we need to install the cookie-parser from npm. and then use(cookie-parser());

Cookie will be always generated from the response object. See it in index.js.

response.cookie(), takes 2 parameters, one is name of the cookie and next is the value.


Now run the application and see the cookies stored in the browser.

Also see the cookies without doing anything in the postman for POST method.

All the request that are send inside the index.js file,that all can have cookies.

We can also end the cookies by giving the specifiec time.
