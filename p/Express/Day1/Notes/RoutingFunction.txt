special routing method, app.all(), it can have all http methods. So far we are specifically mention,
now i use app.all, i used it in server.js

// app.all("/secret",(request,respone)=>{
//     respone.send("You are in secret route.");
//     respone.end();
// })

This is the get api, i saw it in chrome.

It can also have POST, PUT, and DELETE http methods. Now i open postman for POST method and do the same
thing.


whether using GET, POST,
PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method supported in the HTTP module.
