See the example in request-object.js

1. request.url stores data about the URL of the request.
2. request.params: holds all GET parameters. 
For this what i have to do, first got to chrome then type localhost:8080/Swetha/24/Ragunathan.
Then i must tell the system to listen the param.

go to get() then 
get('/:name:age:lname')

If i want to get the age itself from the param. 
    console.log(request.params.age);
This is of path paramter or url paramter or path param or url param

query param:

If the param is having ? mark then it is query param.

For this what i have to do, first go to chrome then type localhost:8080/?name=Swetha&age=24&lname=Ragunathan.

For this no need to tell the system to listen the param. Instead just use request.query.

go to get() then 
get('/:name:age:lname')

If we want to send the email and password, we wont send it through get method, because that is visible to
others, so we must use post method. So need to install postman for testing our apis.

Here i must expect the data from the body. Have body parser to send the data.
